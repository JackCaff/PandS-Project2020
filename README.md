### Introduction 

Project was completed as part of the Programming and Scripting module. <br>
In order to complete the project the following was required:

1. **Researching** the Fisher's Iris Data Set (Summary will be included in this README).<br>
2. Downloading the Data Set and including it in the **Repository**.<br>
3. Writing a program call **analysis.py**. This program outputs:<br>
    * A summary of each of the variables to a text file.<br>
    * Saves a histogram of each variable to png files.<br>
    * Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of varaiables.<br>

***Fisher's Iris Data Set***
============================

The Fisher Iris Data set was first introduced by biologist *Ronald Fisher* in his 1936 paper " *The use of multiple measurments in taxonomic problems*. The data set comprises of 150 records captured under 5 attributes for three related species of ***Iris Flower***. These attributes include: <br>
1. Petal Length. <br>
2. Petal Width. <br>
3. Sepal Length. <br>
4. Sepal Width. <br>
5. Class (Species) <br>
These records were then used to quantify the morphologic variation between 1. *Iris Setose*, 2. *Iris Virginica* and 3. *Iris Versicolour* Flower.<br> 
The data set is also known as *Anderson's Iris* data set because the data used in the data set was captured by Edgar Anderson. [2]

***Aim of the Fisher Iris Data Set***
=====================================

The aim of the Data set is to categorize and model the class memebership, of the 3 species of Iris flowers from length and width recorded measurments of Sepals and Petals of each of the flowers.<br>
It is also widely acknowledged as the best known example in the field of machine learning. [3]
